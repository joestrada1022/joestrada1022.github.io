At the Calsys lab, I developed and implemented web scraping solutions to gather cyber threat intelligence from dark web marketplaces. Additionally, I created a full-stack web application to optimize the Captcha solving process, enhancing the automation of data collection for the project.

#### Key Contributions:
- Utilized Selenium to collect malicious hacking-related information from forum discussions and product/service listings on dark web marketplaces, identifying data from 21 vendors and 499 items on one platform. 
- Extracted relevant information from scraped HTML data using Beautiful Soup, meticulously organizing and storing it in a PostgreSQL database for subsequent analysis.
- Contributed to the initial phase of the project aimed at creating a predictive model for cyber threat analysis by ensuring the data collection process was efficient and comprehensive.
- Leveraged Google Drive API and Django to create a full-stack web application, streamlining Captcha renaming for a Captcha Solver meant to automate the scraping process.
