With the app, you take a photo of the inside of your fridge, and it scans the photo and grabs its contents with estimated amounts (in terms of packaging) and generates all possible recipes that can be made from those fridge items (if the user is an item or two short for making a recipe, that gets considered as well). From there, the user can select which ones they want and it would generate a meal plan for the week based off of that as well as a shopping list for things they would need.
