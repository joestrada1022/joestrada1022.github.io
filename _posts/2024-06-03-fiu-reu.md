At my REU at Florida International University, I led research efforts in adversarial machine learning, specifically focusing on developing anti-forensic techniques using GANs to manipulate video source classifiers. I designed and implemented an advanced system that employs adversarial training to modify images based on device-specific characteristics, effectively fooling classifiers while preserving visual integrity for human viewers.

#### Key Contributions:
- Spearheaded research on adversarial machine learning, focusing on anti-forensic applications using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to deceive video source classifiers through targeted and untargeted attacks
- Engineered a system leveraging adversarial training techniques to alter images based on device specifications, ensuring high-accuracy misclassification by classifiers while maintaining visual consistency for human observers.
