For the CubeSat Technology Exploration Program (CubeSTEP) at Cal Poly Pomona, a NASA-funded initiative aimed at developing small-scale space mission technology, I am a member of the newly established Mission Control and Ground Station team. This team was created to develop the ground station necessary for our CubeSat missions. Actual physical development of the Ground Station has not been done yet because of the need to figure out requirements and part research.

#### Key Contributions:
- Conducted comprehensive research on CubeSat part requirements and developed a top-level communication diagram between satellite and ground station, including various operational modes.
- Collaborated with team members to define software requirements and initiate the procurement process for the chosen mission control software.
- Contributed to the ongoing development of a mobile mission control station architecture, focusing on enhancing operational capabilities for current and future CubeSat missions
