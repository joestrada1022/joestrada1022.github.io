The captsone project for my CS4210 Machine Learning and Its Applications Course. 

Within a google collab notebook, we setup code for dataset preparation, model creation, initialization, data preprocessing, and model training. With the trained model, there is also code to run inference in real time using the webcam to classify hand signals.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Machine Learning**:
   - Developed and trained a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify **American Sign Language (ASL)** symbols using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
   
2. **Real-Time Recognition**:
   - Utilized **OpenCV** to capture live camera feed as input for the model.
   - Enhanced the real-time ASL recognition capabilities of the system.
