I'm a Computer Science student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, 
with a passion for software engineering and machine learning. 
My journey began with interactions in cyber-threat intelligence research and participating 
in Google ML workshops. Since then, I've maintained a GPA of 3.8, achieved honors, 
and taken relevant courses in machine learning, GPU computing, software engineering, and more. 


My practical experience includes roles as a cyber-threat intelligence researcher, working on 
sponsored projects by Lockheed Martin for UAV competitions, and Northrop Grumman for UGV control 
systems, where I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world applications. 
Additionally, I've led the Software Engineering Association, 
creating initiatives to support students with little to no experience. 
I presented autonomous vehicle research at the Spring 2024 College of Science Research 
Symposium and conducted adversarial machine learning research during the NSF REU Security of Smart Things program at Florida International University. 

My background in computer science encompasses programming, machine learning, computer vision, 
robotics, control systems, and leadership roles, makes me ready to take on new challenges in the field.
